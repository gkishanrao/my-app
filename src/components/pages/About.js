                    <p className='lead'>  Hello! I’m a Ph.D. student at Howard University’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). I develop and enhance security tools for wireless communication in the Internet of Things (IoT) applications using different technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Mobile Edge Computing, Software-Defined Systems, and Cryptographic Protocols. I am advised by Dr. Danda B. Rawat (Associate Dean for Research & Graduate Studies (CEA), Director (Data Science & Cybersecurity Center), and Director (DoD Center of Excellence in AI/ML) at Howard University. ) and am a part of the Data Science and Cybersecurity Center (DSC2),  Cybersecurity and Wireless Networking Innovations (CWiNs) and Center of Excellence in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning (COE-AI/ML) labs. I was awarded the Graduate Research Assistant in 2021.</p>
                    <p className='lead'>I have done extensive research on this issue and presented a survey on recent advances in mobile edge computing and content caching, including caching insertion and expulsion policies, the behavior of the caching system, and caching optimization based on wireless networks. Some of the important open challenges in mobile edge computing with content caching are identified and discussed. Also compared edge, fog and cloud computing in terms of delay which help researchers to get a thorough understanding of recent advances in mobile edge computing and content caching in mobile wireless networks. In the future, my work will focus on (1) Emerging sustainable and intelligent transportation systems, including connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), transportation electrification, mobility-as-a service (MaaS), and active transportation. (2) Application of machine learning techniques to modeling, secure and control of transportation systems. (3) Develop best security approaches for manned and unmanned vehicles and systems which we use in emergency and military applications. </p>
